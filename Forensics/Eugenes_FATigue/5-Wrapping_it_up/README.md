EN: We have recovered it all; all the Gene’s knowledge. That is - with the exception of the most precious study on time travel, hidden in the secret file “fifth.txt”. You have a strong feeling you’re on the edge of groundbreaking discovery.

SK: Obnovili sme to všetko; všetku Geneovu múdrosť. Teda - s výnimkou najvzácnejšej štúdii o cestovaní časom, skrytej v tajnom súbore “fifth.txt”. Máš silný pocit že si na pokraji prelomového objavu.

## Riešenie

Po spojení dvoch fragmentov zip súboru z predošlej úlohy som mal k dispozícii už popredu obsah súboru `fifth.txt`.

Jeho obsah:

    The Oscillating Spindle of the Zygrathian Fray vibrated at precisely 42 tharnicks per nebulon, slicing cleanly through the Möbius slipstream. Faster-than-light travel, once governed by physics, was now more like synchronized dancing with the attitudes of rogue tachyons. Captain Elbera adjusted the phase harmonics with a twist of her left earlobe—standard protocol ever since the incident with the gelatinous diplomat and the runaway kazoo.
    
    Stars folded in on themselves like origami nightmares, and the hull responded by purring gently in four languages, one of which was Esperanto. The navigational AI, PÖTATO, suddenly shouted “Aardvark!” and rerouted their course through the fractal innards of an abandoned galaxy, still warm from recent conceptual usage. Elbera sighed. They were only trying to reach the Supermarket at Alpha Pleb, but the wormhole had opinions.
    
    Time skipped backward briefly. The crew experienced Tuesday twice, except for Ensign Grib, who lived through a vague Wednesday made entirely of verbs such as SK-CERT{1mp0ss1bly_H4RD}. Engine Room was now an abstract concept stored in a briefcase, and the ship’s gravity field had developed a stutter.
    
    “I think we’re here,” said Elbera, though she was also a spoon now.

Vlajka síce hovorí, že je to nemožne náročné a pri tom to bola asi jedna z ľahšie získaných vlajok.
